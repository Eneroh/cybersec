=== Data retrieval project ===
Project time: 24-48 hours, as disk scanning may take a while depending.

--- Idea ---

Purchase USED hard drive for cheap from ebay or gumtree and attempt to retrieve information from the drive.

May also be performed on a NEW drive I purchase, fill it with baloney then try and clear myself without utilizing shred and try and retrieve info butttttt, may be less effective as I have more knowledge on data destruction than typical users. Hm, further investigation required.

To ensure data is destroyed utilization of GNU shred is a requirement as it mangles any previous 0's and 1's on the drive.

Perhaps purchasing from an ebay advertisement that doesn't display drive SMART data, as less likely to run into proper data destruction.

Through closer inspection: dderescue or testdisk seem like potential applications

--- Procedure ---
Step 1:
Locate and purchase drive from ebay.

Step 2:
Prepare test environment for data retrieval, i.e. external drive bay to perform testing, as well as relevant applications prepared to proceed, isolated environment may also be required as you never know what you're getting from ebay heh.

Step 3:
Begin data retrieval using testdisk, dderescue/other applications that may be relevant.

Step 4:
Observe results.
