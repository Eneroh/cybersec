=== financially_motivated_threat_actor_master - sentinel focus ===

--- alert associated ---
Suspicious activity linked to a financially motivated actor detected on one endpoint

--- tables ---
DeviceNetworkEvents
ASimDnsActivityLogs

--- items required for procedure ---
> Sandboxing tool: Windows sandbox, urlscan.io
> Smartphone/home network
> MS Defender
> MS Sentinel
> IP information gathering tool: abuseipdb, virustotal
> IP VPN proxy checker: ip2proxy.com, ipinfo.io

--- procedure ---
1. Gather relevant information
2. Perform OSINT
OSINT tools, entraid details, defender and sentinel
3. Perform deep dive
Review OSINT materials including information dumps that are associated to the suspicious activity, this will be vital in resolving the alert
Device timeline, as well as Advanced hunting, urlscan.io, reviewing the site itself in a sandbox. Inspect element will be vital.

There are two options in this particular instance:
Options:
3.1. urlscan.io focused
Check each webpage/navbar url via urlscan.io and with OSINT information check for relevant script mentioned in OSINT located writeup

3.2. windows sandbox, inspected element focused
Check each page in windows sandbox and utilize inspect element for relevant js file "<script>.js" once discovered, present information.

4. Present findings
Present findings in a logical and concise manner

--- useful kql queries ---
1.
Tied to Device Timeline > Hunt for related activity
let selectedTimestamp = datetime(<datetime>)
search in(DeviceProcessEvents,DeviceNetworkEvents,DeviceFileEvents,DeviceRegistryEvents,DeviceLogonEvents,DeviceImageLoadEvents,DeviceEvents,BehaviorEntities)
Timestamp between ((selectedTimstamp - 30m) .. (selectedTimestamp + 30m)) and DeviceId == "<DeviceId>"
| sort by Timestamp desc
| extend Relevance = ifff(Timestamp == selectedTimestamp,"Selected event",ifff(Timestamp < selectedTimestamp,"Earlier event","Later event"))
| project-reorder Relevace, RemoteUrl

--- remediation ---
> Perform AV scan on machine affected
> Utilize internal proxy/firewall to determine what occurred
> Add domain/s to network appliance block list
> Query network appliance for other devices affected/visited domain
> Validate activity with user
> Review online resources for next steps
> Review network appliance for additional requests
> Ensure no files were downloaded during time period

GOOGLE THE DOMAIN AND LOOK FOR RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO SPOT THE TRIGGER
CHECK EACH PAGE TO LOCATE THE SUSPICIOUS JAVASCRIPT ELEMENT
