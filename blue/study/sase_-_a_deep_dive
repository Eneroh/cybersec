--- preface ---
So to begin, Im hearing a lot about Secure access service edge (SASE) presently and with this I realise my knowledge is lacking. Therefore, Im going to better my knowledge in relation to this.

--- what is SASE? ---
1st definition - more general
Secure access service edge is a security framework that unites wide area networking with zero trust security to safeguard cloud-based enterprises. 

2nd definition - more specific
A security framework that converges software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN) and zero trust security solutions into a converged cloud-delivered platform that securely connects users, systems, endpoints and remote networks to apps and resources.

3rd definition - palo alto
A cloud native architecture that unifies SD-WAN with multiple security functions like SWG, CASB, FWaaS and ZTNA into one.

4th definition - fortinet
A cloud architecture model that combines network and security as a service together and delivers them as a single cloud service.

5th definition - cloudflare
An architectural model that converges network connectivity with network security functions and delivers them through a single cloud platform and/or centralised policy control.

6th definition - cisco
A network architecture that combines VPN and SD-WAN capabilities with cloud-native security functions such as: secure web gateways, cloud access security brokers, firewalls and zero-trust network access. Delivered from the cloud and provided as a service by a SASE vendor.

7th definition - my own

[Market speak filter - WE ARE NOT SELLING ANYONE ANYTHING]

--- what is SASE? ---
SASE or secure access service edge is a cloud security architecture which combines multiple cloud based security products into one.

Security architecture, such as: 
zero trust network access (ZTNA)
cloud access security broker (CASB)
NGFW
FWaaS
SD-WAN
Secure web gateway (SWG)

--- what are the benefits? ---
Flexibility and scalable
Potentially monetarily lucrative (however ultimately depends on business size)
Less lag and optimized performance

=========================

--- what are the main traits of SASE? ---
Typically involves 4 traits:
1. Identity-driven - Access is granted based on the identity of users and devices.
2. Cloud-native - Both infrastructure and secuity solutions are cloud-delivered.
3. Supports all edges - Every physical, digital and logical edge is protected.
4. Globally distributed - Users are secured no matter where they work.

--- what is the main goal of SASE? ---
Provide a seamless user experience, optimized connectivity as per cloud infrastructure, comprehensive security.

Does not backhaul traffic like traditional datacenters or private networks for security inspections, SASE enables devices and remote systems to access apps and resources whereever they are-at any time.

--- Key components of SASE ---
> Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN)
> Secure web gateway (SWG)
> Cloud access security broker (CASB)
> Firewall as a service (FWaaS)
> Zero trust network access (ZTNA)
> Centralised and unified management

--- benefits of SASE [market speak] ---
When properly implemented SASE allows organisations to ensure secure access no matter where their users, devices or apps are located. Additionally SASE offers:
1. Flexible, comprehensive security from threat protection to next-generation firewall (NGFW)
2. Optimized performance and improved user experience (for example, reduced latency and on-demand security)
3. Reduced cost and complexity, thanks to consolidation of key networking and security functions into fewer solutions.
4. Agile, scalable network edge, which accelerates digital transformation and IoT adoption and enables the modern hybrid workforce with better productivity and reduce complexity across the organisation.

--- simplified benefits of SASE ---
1. Flexibility and comprehensive security ranging from multiple security solutions
2. Optimized performance and user experience
3. Reduced cost and complexity due to key components being moved to the cloud and no longer entirely necessary on-site
4. Agile, scalable network edge - essentially points back to flexibility or point 1

--- personal interpretation (what I will use when explaining SASE to another party) ---
SASE or secure access service edge is a cloud security architecture that combines multiple cloud based applications to achieve a goal of: optimizing cloud infrastructure and security the cloud for organisations and businesses.
