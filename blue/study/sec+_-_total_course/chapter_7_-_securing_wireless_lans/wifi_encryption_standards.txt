=== Wi-Fi encryption standards ===
--- Wired Equiv Privacy (WEP) ---
> 802.11 standards
--> RC4 standard
> Began with initialisation vector (IV)
> IV was the weakness

-->- IEEE 802.11i ---
--> AES instead of RC4
> Pre shared key (PSK) instead of IV
  - WPA Entperise (Raidus Server) authentication
--> WAPs and network cards couldnt handle AES encryption at the beginning 
> Wifi protected access (WPA)
  --> RC4 with PSK or RAIDUS server

--- WPA2 ---
> AES encryption
  - RAIDUS and PSK
  - Counter mode/CBC MAC Protocol
    - CCMP
> Can be cracked

-->- WPA3 ---
> Disallows outdated protocols
--> Protected management frames (PMF)
--> No more PSK instead Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE)

--- Wifi Protect Setup (WPS) ---
> Must have WPS capable WAPS and devices
> Press buttons on both router and printer, instead connection (WPA2 encryption connection)
--> Easy to crack now
--> Devices no longer include it
