  - Eradication
> Contact list

--- IRP Life Cycle ---
> Periodic review
> Assign roles
> Regular training
> Update the IRP
--- IRP Process ---
> Prepare
> Identify and contain
> Eradicate
> Recover
> Lessons learned
--- IRP Testing ---
> Designed to detect, contain and eradicate threats
> Walkthrough
> Simulations
> Tabletop exercises
