=== Threats analysis and mitigations actions ===
--- Cyber kill chain analysis ---
--> Trace steps taken for a successful compromise/data exfil event
> Security compromise knowledge can help prevent future breaches
--- Cyber kill chain analysis ---
> Recon
> Intrusion
> Exploitation
> Privilege escalation
> Lateral movement
> Obfuscation/anti-forensics
> Denial of service (DOS)
> Exfiltration
-->- MITRE ATT&CK Framework ---
--> Used for post-compromise id and analysis
  - Threat detection
  - What was done and how was it done?
> Identify attacker techniques
> Mitigation
  - Modify existing firewall, IDS, IPS alert rules
  - Deploy honeypot traps
--- The diamond model of intrusion analysis ---
--> Shows how malicious actors (adversaries) use exploits over an infrastructure against victims
> Stems from use of honeypots

> Adversary
> Victim
> Infra
> Capabilities
-->- Security orchestation, automation and response (SOAR) ---
--> Automate incident response using playbooks
  - Firewall rules, content filters
  - Application allow/deny lists
  - Revoke certs
> Reduce incident response time
