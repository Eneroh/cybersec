=== business impact analysis ===

--- BIA ---
> Identifies how negative incidents will impact business processes and sensitive data
> Prioritize mission-critical processes
  - Payment processing systems
  - Customer/patient records
> Assess risk
  - Identify sensitive data
  - Identify single points of failure
  - Identify security controls and compliance
> Business impact
  - Fines
  - Loss of contracts
> Reputation
> Data loss
  - Breach notification
  - Escalation requirements
  - Exfil
--- Failed component impact --- <<IMPORTANT>>
> Mean time between failures (MTBF)
  - Average time between repairable component failures
  - Software patching
> Mean time to failure (MTTF)
  - Average time between non-repairable component failures
  - Hard disks, switches, routers
> Mean time to repair (MTTR)
--- Locating critical resources ---
> Data discovery and classification
  - Where is our sensitive ata?
  - Privacy threshold assessment (PTA)
    ~ First step before implementing solutions related to sensitive data
> Impact on sensitive data (Privacy impact assessment) [PIA]
> Regulatory compliance
--- Business impact ---
> Recovery point objective (RPO)
  - Maximum tolerable amount of data loss
  - Directly related to backup frequency
> Recovery time objective (RTO)
  - Maximum tolerable amount of downtime
  - Return systems and data to usable state
