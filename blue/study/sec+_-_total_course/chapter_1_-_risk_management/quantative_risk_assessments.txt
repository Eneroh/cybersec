=== Quantative risk assessments ===
> Based on numeric values
> Asset value (AV)
> Exposure factor (EF)
  - Percentage of asset value loss when negative incident occurs
> Single loss expectancy (SLE)
  - How much loss during on negative incident?
  - Asset value (AV) * exposure value (EF) = single loss expectancy (SLE)
  - AV * EF = SLE
  
  AV / <risk of downtime> 3 hours / 24 hours in a day = EF
  
> Annualized rate of occurence (ARO)
  - Expected number of yearly occurences
  - 2-3 times per year
  
> Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
  - Total yearly cost of bad things happening
  - ALE = SLE X ARO
