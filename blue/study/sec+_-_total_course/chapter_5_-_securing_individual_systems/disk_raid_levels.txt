=== disk RAID levels ===
--- Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) ---
> Groups disks together to work as one
  - Better performance
  - High availability
> Hardware RAID controller
> Software RAID
  - Slower, less reliable
--- Storage area network (SAN) ---
> Storage from network
> Looks like a local set of disks
> HBA (Host bus array) required for SAN
-->- RAID 0 ---
> Striping
> INCREASED DISK PERF
> Across 3 disks
> Lose everything without redundancy
-->- RAID 1 ---
> Mirroring
> Have 1 backup
-->- RAID 5 ---
> Parity
> INCREASED DISK PERF
> Error recovery, rebuilding
> Striping as well
-->- RAID 6 ---
> 2 disk failures
--- RAID 10 ---
> Mirroring then striped
> 4 disks
