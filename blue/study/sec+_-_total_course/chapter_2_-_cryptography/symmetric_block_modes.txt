=== Symmetric block modes ===
--- Electronic code book (ECB) ---
> NO ONE USES ECB
--- Block modes ---
> Encrypt something then encrypt the next thing
> Cipher block chaining (CBC)
  - Initialization vector
  - XOR
> Cipher feedback (CFB)
  - Initialization vector
  - Encryption then XOR'd
> Output feedback (OFB)
  - Initialization vector, encryption then XOR'd
> Counter (CTR)
  - Nounce + counter then crypted then XOR'd
  - Counter gets incremented
--> ALL ABOVE USE Initialization vector
--> Ensures output block is unique
--- Binary block ---
> Plain text converted into 16-bot, 64-bit or 128-bit binary ciphertext
