=== asymmetric cryptosystems ===
> Symmetric key uses same key to encrypt and decrypt
> Public key (encrypt)
> Private key (decrypt)

--- Eliptical curve cryptography (ECC) ---
> Smaller key, same secrity with increased performance
> Without the single private key, the information cannot be decrypted
