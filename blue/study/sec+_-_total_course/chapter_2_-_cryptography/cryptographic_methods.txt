=== Cryptographic methods ===
--- Encryption/decryption ---
> Symmetic encryption

--- Session key ---
> In-band (in a session online) and out-of-band (travel to give person key)

--- Ephemeral key ---
> Temporary
> Perfect forward secrecy

--- Asymmetric encryption ---
> Uses a key pair
  - Public key (encrypt)
  - Private key (decrypt)
> Slow but useful in exchanging session keys

--- Cryptosystems ---
> Define key properties, communication requirements for the key exchange and the actions taken through the encryption/decryption process
