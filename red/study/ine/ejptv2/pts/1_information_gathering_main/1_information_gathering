Topic 1:
--- Introduction to information gathering ---
Information gathering is the first step of any penetration test and involves gathering or collecting information about an individual, company, website or system that you are targeting.

The more information you have on the target, the more successful you will be during the latter stages of a penetration test.

Information gathering is typically broken down into two types:
Passive information gathering -
Involves gathering as much information as possible without actively engaging with the target

Active information gathering -
Involves gathering as much information as possible by actively engaging with the target system. (You will require authorization in order to perform active information gathering.
