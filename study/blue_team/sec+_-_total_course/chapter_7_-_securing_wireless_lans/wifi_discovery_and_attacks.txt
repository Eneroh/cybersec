=== Wifi discovery and attacks ===
--- wifi discovery and mapping ---
> War chalking (sidewalk marking)
> War driving (Scan from in vehicle)
> War flying (scan using a drone
--- Malicious WAP targeting ---
> Rogue access point (unauthed wireless AP)
> Evil twin
  - Unauthed wireless ap mimicking valid AP name
--- Wifi AP beacon frames ---
> Sent every ~100ms
> Clients cannot verify beacons
  - Key not established yet
  - Easily forged
> Contains
  - SSID
  - Maximum transmit power
--- Wifi attacks ---
> Connecting to open WLANs
> Cracking WEP passphrase
--> RF signal jamming
  --> Interference
  - Wifi channel overlap
  --> Flood AP with deauthentication (disassociation) packets

--> WLANs can be discovery in proximity due to beacon frames
--> WEP passphrases are easily cracked
--> Client to AP handshakes can be captured to perform offline PSK attacks
