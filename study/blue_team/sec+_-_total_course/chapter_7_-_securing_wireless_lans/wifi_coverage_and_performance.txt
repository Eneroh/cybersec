=== Wifi coverage and performance ===
--> Signal strength weakens over distance
  - Transmission power measured in decibel milliwats (dBm)
> Higher is better
> Atmospheric conditions can affect wireless connectivity
--- Wifi site survey ---
> Conduct during wifi deployment and troubleshooting
> Collect wireless stats
  - Signal strength
  - Noise
  - Channel overlapping
  - Transmission speeds
> Netspot
--> WLANs, signal strength, channel usages and security settings
--> Extended WLAN coverage is possible but ensures channels do not overlap in adjacent cells
--> Wifi heat maps use colors to indicate areas with strong signal strength as well as dead zones
