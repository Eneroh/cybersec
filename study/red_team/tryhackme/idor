=== IDOR - insecure direct object reference ===

A type of access control vulnerability

--- When does IDOR typically occur? ---
When a web server receives user input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents) without sanitising the inputs. Validation server side is required to alleviate this.

--- Examples ---
Example one is a shopping cart invoice link inside an email. You can view other people\'s orders by simply changing the order number via the URL.

https://onlinestore.thm/order/XXXX/invoice

This leaks users full name, address and what they ordered with quantities. It may also leak payment details depending on how much information is present on the invoice/document retrieved.

Very dangerous indeed.
